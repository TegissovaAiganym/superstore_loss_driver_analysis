# Assumptions and Limitations

This analysis is based on the publicly available Superstore dataset and is subject to the following assumptions and limitations:

## Assumptions
- Profit values are assumed to already account for product cost and operational expenses.
- Discount is treated as the primary pricing lever affecting profitability.
- Customer names are assumed to represent unique customers (no deduplication performed).
- Delivery speed is treated as a proxy for operational performance.

## Limitations
- No detailed cost breakdown is available (e.g., manufacturing, shipping, or warehousing costs).
- Promotional intent behind discounts (e.g., strategic loss leaders) cannot be directly observed.
- The dataset represents historical transactions and does not include demand elasticity or competitor pricing.
- Results are specific to the analyzed dataset and may not generalize to other businesses or industries.

## Analytical Scope
- The analysis focuses on identifying root causes of losses rather than forecasting or optimization.
- Findings should be interpreted as decision-support insights, not prescriptive pricing rules.
