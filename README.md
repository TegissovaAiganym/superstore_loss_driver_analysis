📦 Product-Level Loss Driver Analysis (Superstore Dataset)
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes product-level profitability using the Superstore dataset, with the goal of identifying why certain products generate losses despite overall positive performance.
Rather than stopping at surface-level KPIs, the analysis drills down into pricing, customer behavior, time patterns, and operational factors to identify the true drivers of losses.
The project combines SQL-based exploratory analysis with Power BI storytelling dashboards.
